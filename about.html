        <h3>Moomin Island's Origins</h3>
        <img src="photos/passport.jpg" alt="Island Representative Contact information" id="passport"/>    
        <p>
            Moomin Island was founded by island representative, Kat, March 19th, 2020. This island was named after Moominvalley, 
            a finnish fictional book series written in the 40's to the 80's by the author Tove Jansson.
            This series was adapted later into several animated television series, notably in the 1990's
            and more recently in 2019. The flag of Moomin Island depicts one of the main characters of 
            Moominvalley, Snufkin.

        <h4>Development of Moomin Island:</h4>
        <p>
            Moomin Island has come a far way in it's development, but many areas are still under construction.
            We currently maintain a 3 star island rating, according to Isabelle. Our goal is to allow strangers
            to wander around the island freely, but for now we ask that you stay mostly in the developed town
            areas until further notice.
